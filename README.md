# Time Dependent Drake Equation
Based on the famous Drake Equation, but not just a steady state solution.
 
# Summary
* very rough, mostly abandoned
* tech life forms between 2B and 6.5B yr after the star
* 3.6% of potential habitable stars eventually yeild tech life
* stars formed between 2B and 6.5B yr ago contribute to our cosmic neighbours
	* assuming Rstar constant by then, this puts us into steady state
		* therefore the standard Drake Equation should work fine
* work done by Abraham Loeb, Rafael A. Batista, David Sloan does this better
	* [Relative Likelihood for Life as a Function of Cosmic Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08448.pdf)
	* [When Did Life First Emerge in the Universe?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-did-life-first-emerge-in-the-universe/)
	* this study shows we are likely at the start of lifespans
	* I could redo my attempt with some of their life calculations
		* calculate how many extict species there are
		* try to calcuate N as a function of time
		* non-trivial, so I will hold off for now
* simulation didn't work very well, and adding rigor is outside of the capabilities of my computer
	* Poisson isn't a great approximation because odds change over time (presumably)
