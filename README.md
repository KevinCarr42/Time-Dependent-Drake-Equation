# Time Dependent Drake Equation
Based on the famous Drake Equation, but not just a steady state solution.
 
# Summary
* very rough, mostly abandoned
* tech life forms between 2B and 6.5B yr after the star
* 3.6% of potential habitable stars eventually yeild tech life
* stars formed between 2B and 6.5B yr ago contribute to our cosmic neighbours
	* assuming Rstar constant by then, this puts us into steady state
		* therefore the standard Drake Equation should work fine
* work done by Abraham Loeb, Rafael A. Batista, David Sloanb does this better
	* Relative Likelihood for Life as a Function of Cosmic Time
	* this study shows we are likely at the start of lifespans
	* I could redo this study with their life calculations
* simulation didn't work very well, and adding rigor is outside of the capabilities of my computer
